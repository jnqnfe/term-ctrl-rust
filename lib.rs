//!
//! Text output to a console/terminal can (sometimes) be modified with certain (limited) effects
//! (colors, boldness, etc). This is achieved by injecting a special sequence of characters into the
//! output sent to the console/terminal. This special sequence will be interpreted by the
//! console/terminal when it displays the output.
//!
//! This is not available on Windows (apparently), and should only be used otherwise when stdout is
//! actually a tty (you wouldn't want these control sequences to exist in output that the user is
//! piping into a text file or another program).
//!
//! This crate provides tools and definitions to assist in using these effects.
//!
//! # The sequence pattern
//!
//! The special sequence to be injected into the output sent to the console/terminal is comprised of
//! four parts:
//!
//!  1. `\u{1B}`, the escape char
//!  2. `[`
//!  3. One or more numbers using `;` as a separator
//!  4. `m`
//!
//! The numbers used in the third part each correspond to a particular effect. The effects specified
//! are applied in sequence and are applied cumulatively both with respect to previous effects in
//! the same sequence and also to any existing effects previously applied by a past sequence. There
//! are no numbers assigned for turning off individual effects, just one 'reset' effect (`0`) which
//! removes all effects currently applied.
//!
//! An example: `"\u{1B}[31;1m"` specifies two effects, red text (`31`) and bold text (`1`).
//!
//! No list of effect â†” number mapping is given here, just common sequences.
//!
//! # Resetting
//!
//! When resetting text back to "normal", prefer `RESET` (`"\u{1B}[0m"`) rather than setting
//! color to black (or white).
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! Injecting sequences (irregardless of whether or not it is a good idea to do so)
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! const RESET: &str = "\u{1B}[0m";
//! const RED_BOLD: &str = "\u{1B}[31;1m";
//! println!("normal-text {}red-and-bold-text{} normal-text", RED_BOLD, RESET);
//! ```
//!
//! Injecting sequences while being careful of whether or not to do so (of which there are many
//! potential solutions, of varying efficiency)
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! const RESET: &str = "\u{1B}[0m";
//! const BOLD: &str = "\u{1B}[1m";
//! let format = term_ctrl::color_supported();
//! let filter = |seq| { match format { true => seq, false => "" } };
//! println!("normal-text {}possibly-bold-text{} normal-text", filter(BOLD), filter(RESET));
//! ```
